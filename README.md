-   Drag and drop links to reorder them
-   Add profile details like profile picture, first name, last name, and email
-   Receive validations if the profile details form is saved with no first or last name
-   Preview their devlinks profile and copy the link to their clipboard
-   View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
